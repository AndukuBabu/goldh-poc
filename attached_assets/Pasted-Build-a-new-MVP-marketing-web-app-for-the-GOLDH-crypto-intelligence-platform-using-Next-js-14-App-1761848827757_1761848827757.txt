Build a new MVP marketing web app for the GOLDH crypto intelligence platform using:

Next.js 14 (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

NextAuth for email sign-in (password + magic link)

wagmi/viem for optional wallet connection (MetaMask)

This app is intended for both experienced users and crypto-curious beginners. Design must be clean, modern, elegant — with simple language and strong FOMO appeal. It’s being built for a crypto convention launch.

🖼️ Assets to Use

The GOLDH logo file will be uploaded separately as logo.png. Do not just drop it in as an image — integrate it visually into the layout/header.

🎨 Design System

Use this black-gold brand palette:

Color	Use
#C7AE6A	Primary GOLD highlight
#d5c28f	Soft gold accent
#b99a45	Strong gold
#e3d6b4	Off-gold background
#1a1a1a	Dark section background
#000000	Base background

Font should feel fintech/professional but clean — use Tailwind defaults.

🧱 Pages and Features to Build
1. / — Landing Page

Hero section with the logo on the left and tagline + CTA buttons on the right

Primary buttons:

“Start Free” → goes to /signin

“Learn More” → smooth-scrolls to Features section (not jumps)

Include the following sections:

✅ “GOLDH Token Launching Soon” box with FOMO text

✅ “Early User Status” box: “Sign up early and get exclusive benefits. More soon.”

✅ “Features” section: short, simple tiles for each platform benefit

✅ “Latest Crypto News” strip: a horizontally auto-scrolling feed of real or mock headlines with clickable links

✨ Logo must be styled into the layout (not just dropped as an image block)

Copy must be simple, aimed at crypto beginners

2. /signin — Sign In Page

Sign in with email + password

Also support magic link fallback via NextAuth (console log OK in dev)

Wallet connection (via MetaMask) should be optional

If user skips it, allow them to continue

If they do connect wallet, mark them as “Premium” if their GOLDH token balance ≥ 5000

After login, redirect to /dashboard

3. /dashboard — Dashboard Page

Must be gated (auth required)

✅ Remove:

Claim tokens section

Token address display

✅ Add:

“GOLDH Features Coming Soon” teaser block (FOMO style)

“Crypto News Feed” section with linkable headlines

Show “Premium” badge if wallet is connected & has enough GOLDH (mockable)

4. /learn — Learning Hub Page (Revamped)

Build a full knowledge center for crypto beginners, not just a few definitions.

Structure:

🔍 Search bar at the top: user types any crypto/blockchain term, and it scrolls to (or expands) the relevant topic.

📚 Topic sections below: each is a collapsible dropdown/accordion (can use headless UI).

Topics to include (you can stub these out with dummy content to start):

What is Blockchain?

What is a Wallet?

What is an Airdrop?

What is a Token (vs Coin)?

What is Staking?

What is TVL (Total Value Locked)?

What is APY?

What is a Smart Contract?

What is the BNB Smart Chain?

What is the GOLDH platform?

UX Requirements:

Clicking a topic in search automatically scrolls and expands that section.

Must be clean, mobile-friendly, and visually aligned with the rest of the site.

Tone must be non-technical and welcoming, like an onboarding assistant.

Bonus (optional): consider showing a “You might also like” link at the bottom of each section that leads to a related term.✅ Extra Requirements

Ensure all anchor links (e.g. “Features” in nav) scroll smoothly on the page

Use tailwind.config.ts to define the brand color palette

Use app/layout.tsx for global fonts, <Header />, and consistent layout

Implement all pages under app/ directory using App Router

Use dotenv and create a .env.local.example file for:

NEXTAUTH_SECRET

NEXTAUTH_URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL

NEXT_PUBLIC_BSC_RPC
