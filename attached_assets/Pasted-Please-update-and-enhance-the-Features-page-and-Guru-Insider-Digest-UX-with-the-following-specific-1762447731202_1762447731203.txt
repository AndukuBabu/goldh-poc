Please update and enhance the Features page and Guru & Insider Digest UX with the following specifications:

🔧 Features Page Enhancements

General Design & Navigation Behavior:

When I’m on the /features page, highlight “Features” in the top navigation bar to indicate it’s the current route.

Replace all placeholder lorem ipsum text with actual descriptions (see content section below).

Each feature card (Digest, UMF, Economic Calendar) must have:

A button or clickable area that navigates to a dedicated fullscreen view of the selected feature (route-based: e.g., /features/guru, /features/umf, /features/calendar).

Smooth transitions when navigating between feature summaries and fullscreen views.

Interactive Feature Cards (Digest, UMF, Calendar):

On hover:

Apply a glow effect using Tailwind (soft gold border glow).

Slight scale-up animation for the hovered card (e.g., transform scale-105).

Add a “Full View” icon or button on each card for desktop and mobile.

📰 Guru & Insider Digest (GID) Changes

Component Behavior:

Truncate digest preview list in the dashboard.

Add a “Full View” button in the GID component. On click, expand GID to fullscreen mode (route: /features/guru or modal-style).

When user hovers over any individual digest item, apply:

A highlight border glow (same gold brand color).

A slight vertical expansion of that card only.

Maintain mobile responsiveness.

🧠 Features Page Copy Content (Replace Lorem Ipsum)

Use the following actual text for the cards and their full-width sections:

📅 Economic Calendar

"Global crypto-relevant macroeconomic events delivered in real time — with intelligent summaries, live countdowns, and impact signals powered by AI. From Fed decisions to inflation releases, never get blindsided again."

📚 Guru & Insider Digest

"Whale alerts. Smart wallet movements. Institutional fund flows. This isn’t your average crypto news feed — this is the insider edge. Curated with machine learning and driven by real blockchain data."

📊 Universal Market Financials (UMF)

"One page to track everything. Token prices, market caps, daily volumes, and trend summaries across the top 100 assets. Built for context-first investing and supported by beautiful, responsive UX."

✅ Implementation Requirements

Use Tailwind for all styling effects (hover, animations).

Implement feature expansion behavior using either route navigation or fullscreen modal logic (your discretion based on routing strategy).

Ensure all sections are fully mobile optimized and consistent with dark fintech design.

Integrate these enhancements cleanly into the current /features page and reuse the existing GID component logic from the dashboard where relevant.
