Currently, your app treats Guru Digest, UMF, Economic Calendar, etc. as standalone feature modules. But you now want:
Unified asset-level views (e.g., click on BTC → see everything about BTC from all features).


A more dashboard-style landing page that ties your features together.


Cross-feature linking (e.g., an economic event affecting ETH shows under ETH).



✅ What You’ll Need to Do
1. Restructure the Feature Architecture
Today: Pages like /digest, /umf, etc. with mock filters.


Tomorrow: A central page like /asset/BTC that pulls:


Price + chart (from UMF)


Whale/smart money alerts (from Guru Digest)


Related economic events (from Economic Calendar)


Fund flows, sentiment, etc. (later from other layers)


Implementation Step:
Create dynamic route: client/src/pages/asset/[symbol].tsx


Use getAssetData(symbol) (or something like that) to fetch all pieces of info.



2. Update Firestore Structure or Create Aggregation API
You’ll want to fetch asset-centric data instead of module-centric data. This means either:
You reorganize Firebase to nest data by asset (/assets/BTC/{umf, digest, events}), or


You create an API that joins data from different Firestore collections (umfLive, guruDigest, etc.) based on asset tags.


Recommended: Build a server function getAssetDetails(assetSymbol) to bundle this.

3. Refactor Homepage
Turn the homepage into a mini-dashboard:
Show major assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.) as cards


Each card can show:


Price change (from UMF)


of alerts/news (from Digest)


Badge if any high-impact economic event is pending


Clicking on the card → goes to /asset/BTC.

4. Improve Tagging Consistency
To link features across assets, you'll need:
Digest entries to have accurate token tags (["BTC", "SOL"])


Economic events to reference affected assets (manual mapping if needed)


UMF already handles price/snapshot per asset



5. Design Update
Replace isolated feature pages with dropdown filters and unified layout.


Sidebar or tabs per asset could switch between price, news, events.



🔧 What to Tell Replit
Prompt:
 “We want to restructure the app so that instead of siloed feature pages, the core interaction is asset-first. For example, if I click BTC on the homepage, I should see price charts, recent digest alerts, and any related economic events all in one view. Can you:
Create a dynamic route for /asset/[symbol]


Write a new API handler or server utility that joins UMF, Digest, and Economic Calendar data for a given symbol


Refactor homepage to show major tokens as cards linking to their unified asset views.”
